# {Notes} Insecure Direct Object References (IDORs)

## What is it ? 

IDORs is a type of bug that happens when the application grants direct access to a resource based on the user's requestion without validation. 

More simply, when a user accesses a resource that does not belong to him by directly referencing the object ID, object number or filename.

IDORs happen when an application fails to satisfy the following two conditions:
- Implementing an access control based on user identity
- Randomizing Object IDs and instead keeping references to data objects, like file or a database entry predictable
