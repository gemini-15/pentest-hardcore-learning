## Insecure Direct Object References (IDORs)

### What is it ? 

IDORs is a type of bug that happens when the application grants direct access to a resource based on the user's requestion without validation. 

More simply, when a user accesses a resource that does not belong to him by directly referencing the object ID, object number or filename.

IDORs happen when an application fails to satisfy the following two conditions:
- *Implementing an access control based on user identity*
- *Randomizing Object IDs and instead keeping references to data objects, like file or a database entry predictable*

### How to find IDORs


### Bypassing IDORs protections

### Tools

### Remediations

The application must check the user's identity and permissions before granting access to the resource (by using a `session` cookie for example). 

The application must use a unique, unpredictable key or hash ID to reference each user's resource. 

The combination of these two methods is known as ***fine-grained access control***.
