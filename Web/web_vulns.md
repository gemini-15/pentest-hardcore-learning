## Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### What is it ? 
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites.

## Directory Traversals

### Whats is it ? 
***Directory Traversals*** attacks aims to give access to files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder, by playing with `../` and/or paths or absolute paths to explore other files that we supposedly should not have access. 


### Identifying Directory Traversals

Basically looking for pages that tries to request files or that uses open functions to render files from the webroot. 

### usage with curl (`--path-as-is` option)
The usage with `curl` must contain the `--path-as-is` flag. 
```bash
curl --path-as-is http://example.com/page=../../../../etc/passwd
```

### Some considerations about encoding the payload
the `../` can be filtered by web servers or WAFs, or even the web app. 
We will then have to use some URL encoding or else to bypass that : 
```
instead of 
    ../ -> %2e%2e/
```


## File inclusion Vulnerabilities 
 
### LFI on Windows
The changes concerns ***file paths and code execution***. 
We must adapt it for what we will access. For example for log poisonning (which will be available in `/var/log/apache2/access.log` for ex) will be present at a different path for example `C:\xampp\apache\logs\` when using XAMPP. 

Most modern frameworks and languages have protections mechanisms against LFI & RFI but we can still find some on nodeJS (with a lot of luck I guess???). 



## Insecure Direct Object References (IDORs)

### What is it ? 

IDORs is a type of bug that happens when the application grants direct access to a resource based on the user's requestion without validation. 

More simply, when a user accesses a resource that does not belong to him by directly referencing the object ID, object number or filename.

IDORs happen when an application fails to satisfy the following two conditions:
- *Implementing an access control based on user identity*
- *Randomizing Object IDs and instead keeping references to data objects, like file or a database entry predictable*

### How to find IDORs


### Bypassing IDORs protections

### Tools

### Remediations

The application must check the user's identity and permissions before granting access to the resource (by using a `session` cookie for example). 

The application must use a unique, unpredictable key or hash ID to reference each user's resource. 

The combination of these two methods is known as ***fine-grained access control***.
