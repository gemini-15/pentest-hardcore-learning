# WEB pentest notesÂ 

## Subdomain enumeration

### Reminders check-list 
- [ ] Checking for subdomains
- [ ] requesting the `robot.txt` file 
- [ ] check the CMS' versions 
### Subdomain discovery
Subdomain enumeration doesn't work well with `gobuster`. It's more interesting to use `ffuf` [https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf).

- notes on ffuf : [https://codingo.io/tools/ffuf/bounty/2020/09/17/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ffuf.html](https://codingo.io/tools/ffuf/bounty/2020/09/17/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ffuf.html)

Example usage of DNS enum with a 200 response filter :
```bash
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http:/domain.go/ -H "Host: FUZZ.domain.go" -mc 200
```
