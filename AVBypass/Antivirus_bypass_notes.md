# AV bypass notes and checklist

## Notes 
- Its generally more beneficial to use scripts instead of PE exe => apparently more difficult for AV to determine if the script is malicious as it's ran inside the interpreter and is not executable (no obvious disass from a text file). 
- AVs often review variable names, comments and logic, which can be changed in a script 


## On-disk evasion techniques
Usage of obfuscating techniques when stored on a physical disk. 

One of the early methods make use of *packers*, which are compression techniques (deter reverse-engineering and obfuscate the contents of an executable). 

*Obfuscators* reorganize and mutate the code which makes it harder to reverse-engineer. It is achieved by for example replacing instructions, inserting irrelevant instructions (dead code), splitting and reordering functions...

*Crypter* makes it possible to have an encrypted executable that is only decrypted at run-time in memory. 

See enigma protector (a software protector). 

## In-memory evasion techniques

*In-memory injections or PE injection*  makes use on the manipulation if volatile memory (RAM). 

## Thread injection : Remote process memory injection 


## Using shellter

## Using veil framework
