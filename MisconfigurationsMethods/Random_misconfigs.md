# Random Misconfigurations tips and notes

## Bash 

### equal misconfiguration ( == instead of -eq)

Using `==` is not the same as using `-eq` when comparing string in certain comditions.

Using `==` in a condition statement with the testing brackets `[[ ... ]]` instead of `[ ... ]` does ***pattern matching***. 

So if we have something like : 
```bash
VER_PASSWD=$(cat /path/passwordfile)

read -s -p "enter password: " PASSWD

if [[ $VER_PASSWD == $PASSWD ]]; then # here is pattern matching 
    # rest of condition
```

We can guess the result of the variable `$VER_PASSWD` by looping through all chars, and if it contains that pattern it will return the right condition.
