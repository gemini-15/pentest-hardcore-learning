# Pivoting and tunneling notes (Port redirection and SSH Tunneling)

- *When we move from one machine to another machine in the same network*, it's called ***pivoting***.
- *When we move into another subnetwork*, it's called ***tunneling***. 

## checklist

### SSH tunneling 

#### SSH local port forwarding
In SSH port forwarding, packets are not forwarded by the same host that listens for packets. An SSH connection is made between two hosts, a listening port is opened by the ***SSH client*** and all packets received on this port are ***tunneled through the SSH connection*** to the ***SSH server***.
