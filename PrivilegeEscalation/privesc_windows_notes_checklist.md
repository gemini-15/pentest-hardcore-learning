# Windows privilege escalation

- [ ] checking the `windows/win.ini` file 
- Key information to leverage :
    - [ ] Username and hostname
    - [ ] Group memeberships of the current user
    - [ ] Existing users and groups
    - [ ] OS version and architecture
    - [ ] Network information
    - [ ] Installed applications
    - [ ] running processes

## Windows privileges and Access control mechanisms
### Security Identifier (SID)
Example:
```
S-1-5-21-1336799502-1441772794-948155058-1001
```
- S : is for indicating that the string is an SID.
- 1 : version of the SID implementation
- 5 : Determines the identifier authority. 5 is the most common and represents the *NT Authority* and is used for local, domain users and groups. 
- the rest : represents the sub-authorities of the identifier authority. domain identifier and relative identifier (RID). 
- 1001 defines that relative identifier. 

### Access Token 
When a user authentifies, an access token is assigned to that user. The token describes various information that defines the *security context*. 

when a user starts a process, a token is assigned to the objects related. This token is called the *primary token* and specifies which permissions the process or threads have when interacting with another object and is a copy of the access token of the user. 

A thread can also have an *impersonate token*. And provides a different security context than the process that owns the thread. 

### Mandatory Integrity Control

Mandatory Integrity are *integrity levels* to control acess to securable objects (hierarchies of trust).

### User Account Control
UAC is a security feature that protects the OS by running most applications with standard user privs. It leverages two tokens, a standard user token, and an administrator token which is the consent prompt on Windows. 

## Information Gathering 

- We can get the **username** and **hostname** using `whoami`.
- listing all the groups a user is in `whoami /groups`. 
- to obtain a list of all local users we can use `net user`or `Get-LocalUser` (show also if enabled with description). 
- Obtaining a list of all local groups : `net localgroup` or `Get-LocalGroup`. 
- Listing the members of a group : `Get-LocalGroupMember <groupName>`
