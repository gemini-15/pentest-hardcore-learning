# Section 1 : Getting comfortable with Kali linux


## 1 - Finding your way around Kali

### Exercices 

``` 
$ man cat 
$ man -k file compression
$ which pwd 
$ sudo updatedb && locate wce32.exe
``` 

this last one is a bit harder from the others. The goal here is to find the files modified in the last 24-hours (arguments `-mtime 1`), not owned by root (`! -user root`) and execute `ls -l` on the result without chaining & piping (`-exec ls -l {} ';'`). Hence the command :

``` 
$ find -mtime 1 ! -user root -exec ls -l {} ';'
```

## 2 - Managing Kali linux services

### SSH & HTTP services

usual commands :
``` 
  // to start the services
  $ sudo systemctl start ssh/apache2
  
  // to start the services at boot time 
  $ sudo systemctl enable ssh/apache2
  
  // to get the status of a service
  $ sudo ss -antlp | ssh/apache2
  
  $ systemctl list-unit-files
```

## 3 - Command line fun 

### Bash environment 

To inspect the bash history, simply the use of the `$ history` command. And to re-run a specific command : `$ !n` with `n` the number of the command found on the result of the history command. 


### Piping and redirections 

#### general 

Each program run has 3 data streams connected to it : 
+ STDIN : Standard Input
+ STDOUT : Standard Output
+ STDERR : Standard Error 

the use of piping ( | ) and redirection ( > & <) make it possible to redirect the standard streams. 

#### Redirecting to a new file 
to redirect to a new file , use of '>', example :
```
$ echo 'Hello world' > new_file.txt
```

to redirect to an existing file :
```
$ echo "hello World" >> existing_file.txt
```
The second command will write at the end of existing_file.txt.


#### Redirecting from a file 
to redirect from a file, use of '<', example :
``` 
 $ wc -m < redirecting.txt
 ```
 
#### Redirecting the STDERR

to redirect the STDERR output :
``` 
$ ls test 2> file.txt
```
Because 2=STDERR. 
 
#### Piping 

Piping offers the possibility to execute a command with the resulting output of the one that precedes it :
```
$ cat new_file.txt | wc -m 
```
#### Exercices

```
// Question 1 & 2
$ sudo cat /etc/passwd | sort > ./new_file.txt
```

### Text searching and manipulation
