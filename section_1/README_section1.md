# Section 1 : Getting comfortable with Kali linux


## 1 - Finding your way around Kali

### Exercices 

``` 
$ man cat 
$ man -k file compression
$ which pwd 
$ sudo updatedb && locate wce32.exe
``` 

this last one is a bit harder from the others. The goal here is to find the files modified in the last 24-hours (arguments `-mtime 1`), not owned by root (`! -user root`) and execute `ls -l` on the result without chaining & piping (`-exec ls -l {} ';'`). Hence the command :

``` 
$ find -mtime 1 ! -user root -exec ls -l {} ';'
```
