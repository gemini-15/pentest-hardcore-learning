# LDAP notes and checklist

## Understanding LDAP 
> Some notes on what is important to know and whatnot (and some definitions) 

### What is it 
LDAP (as you might already know) stands for *Lightweight directory Access Protocol* and serves as a protocol for accessing directory services (X.500-based directory services). 

**Type of information stored in the directory :**
- Based on entries.
- An entry is a collection of attributesthat has a globally-unique Distinguished Name (DN). 
- Each entry has a *type* and at least one *value*. example for a type : the common name `cn` or `mail` for email address. the value depends on the type (an email address for `mail` for instance).

**How information is stored in the directory :**
- Information is stored in a tree-like structure which defines the entry.
- Usually structured based on Internet domain names, an example could be : `(CN=some name,OU=Organization,DC=google,DC=com)`.
- `CN`: Common Name, `OU` : Organizational Unit, `DC` : Domain Component.

**How information is referenced :**
- an entry is referenced by a Distinguished Name (DN) 
- for instance, `uid=userid,ou=organization,dc=example,dc=com`

### What are we looking for ? (For information gathering)

## Information gathering on LDAP protocol

### Using nmap
To gain more information about the LDAP network available to us we can start by a `nmap` with LDAP scripts: 
```bash
nmap -sV -n --script "ldap* and not brute" <IP>
```

### Using python's `ldap3`

Connecting to the ugly service : 
```python
import ldap3

server = ldap3.Server('IP', get_info=ldap3.ALL, port=389, use_ssl=False)
connection = ldap3.Connection(server)
connection.bind()

```
