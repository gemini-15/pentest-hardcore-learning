# Networking


## checklist 
- [ ] Must not forget running `nmap` scans on all ports.
- [ ] Must not forget running `nmap` scans on UDP too with `-sU` option.

## Notes on `nmap`

- On nmap, SYN scan (stealth) is the default scan option (to be used with sudo). 
- Upon receiving the ACK, a SYN scan does not bother anymore, and doesn't send the SYN-ACK to complete the three-way handshake. By doing so, the information is not passed to the application layer (only?) and thus isn't registered on any logs. `-sS` option. 
- A complete TCP scan is done with `-sT`
- `-sU`, for UDP scanning 
- OS fingerprinting : `sudo nmap -O <IP> --osscan-guess`
- Printing service banners with `-A` or with `-sV`: `nmap -sT -A <IP>`
